# JavascriptGraphTraversal

This JavaScript file uses depth-first and breadth-first searching algorithms to find routes from one airport in a given list to another. It prints this route to console and logs the Big O complexity associated with finding the result using that searching algorithm.

How to run:
  1. Clone the repository to your local device or download the file.
  2. Ensure you have node.js installed.
  3. Run the following command "node graph.js" in the folder containing the file.

The destination airport can be changed at line 73 and 103 where the functions are called.

Future updates could entail:
  - Expanding this into a full fledged web app with a GUI;
  - Allowing for user input to change and set certain parameters in browser; and
  - Expanding the capabilities through importing of real world data.
